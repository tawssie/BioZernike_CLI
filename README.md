# BioZernike_CLI
This repository provides a CLI version of BioZernike for comparing the computation time with ZMPY3D.

The source code for BioZernike is available at https://github.com/biocryst/biozernike/. This pre-built Java version integrates BioJava (https://biojava.org/) to read PDB structure files, which BioZernike does not support."

ZMPY3D is a project that implements 3D Zernike moments using NumPy, TensorFlow, and CuPy.
